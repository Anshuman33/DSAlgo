# DSAlgo

## Introduction
This repository consists of various *data structures and algorithms* implementations I have learnt throughout my coding journey.

## Programming Language used
For now all the programs have been written in C++ only. Other programming languages might be included in the future.

## Directory Structure
The programs are organized in several folders for easy access as shown below:-
1. `DataStructs` : Consists of template based data structures like Priority Queue.
2. `PatternMatching` : Consists of Pattern matching algorithms like KMP.
3. `Searching` : Consists of searching algorithms like Linear Search, Binary Search, BFS, DFS, etc. 
4. `Sorting`: Consists of sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, etc.

**Note: This repository is in continual development. Newer programs and algorithms implementations/modifications will be added soon.**
